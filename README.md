-- 10/18/23 / 10/19/23 - Configuring postgre/postgis AWS database + ec2 instance(dont quote me on this) for API backend for app. Had to switch from SQLite due to geograpic behavior of data, would be very very slow to search through all the points. Database architecture complete, importing and formatting to Postgis required format then testing performance.
